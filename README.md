# lecture-notes

These are notes from some math courses I've taught. Please use them however you like.

`/linear_algebra` contains full lecture notes and tutorial problems from teaching a first course in linear algebra for science students (MATH 223) at the University of Toronto in 2017. This was effectively the first math course I ever taught (I taught the same course in 2016).

`/graph_theory` contains selected course materials from teaching undergraduate graph theory at McMaster University in 2019.

`/combinatorics` contains partial lecture notes from teaching undergraduate combinatorics at McMaster University in 2020.

`/proofs` contains lecture slides from the Fall 2021 course "Introduction to Mathematical Reasoning" at McMaster University.
