# lecture-notes

These are notes from some math courses I've taught. Please use them however you like.

`/linear_algebra` contains full lecture notes and tutorial problems from teaching a first course in linear algebra for science students (MATH 223) at the University of Toronto in 2017. This was effectively the first math course I ever taught (I taught the same course in 2016).

`/graph_theory` contains selected course materials from teaching undergraduate graph theory at McMaster University in 2019.

`/combinatorics` contains partial lecture notes from teaching undergraduate combinatorics at McMaster University in 2020.

`/proofs` contains lecture slides from the Fall 2021 course "Introduction to Mathematical Reasoning" at McMaster University.

# Why am I sharing these notes?

There are many good sources of information on these topics that are freely available elsewhere. Why am I bothering to curate my notes here?

First, I think these notes contain some useful, valuable things. If anyone can benefit from them, I would be very happy.

Second, I often reflect on the purpose and practice of teaching math. These documents are a helpful partial record to myself that sometimes guides that reflection. They are particularly interesting to me because they follow my personal progression. Of course, they do not tell a complete story. They contain no information about what happened in lectures, office hourse, assignments, or exams. They don't (can't) say what students actually learned (or not), nor how they may have eventually used what they learned in their own lives (or not). But to me they are a useful reminder of some of these things.

Finally, these notes are the result of imperfect, flawed attempts to teach math. I still don't know exactly what I'm doing. My decisions and actions often defy my own models. Sometimes this is because my models are incomplete or wrong. Sometimes it is because learning math defies simple models (and all models that fit in my brain are simple). Sometimes it's because I ran out of time or energy. I learn new things about teaching every time I do it. I share these notes because they are imperfect, but I am proud of what I've achieved.
