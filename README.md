# lecture-notes

These are notes from math courses I've taught over the years. It is freely available to use as you see fit.

A First Course in Linear Algebra is notes from teaching MATH 223 at the University of Toronto in 2017. These notes are quite detailed and feature tutorial problems. They take a gentle proofs-oriented approach to the fundamentals of linear algebra.

The combinatorics notes are from teaching MATH 3U03 at McMaster University in 2021. They cover combinatorics from a mathematical perspective with a heavy emphasis on combinatorial proofs. The course ended by covering block designs and finite projective planes. 

There are also notes on adjacency matrices, spanning trees, and graph genus from teaching MATH 3V03 at McMaster University in 2019.

The folder `/proofs` contains lecture slides from the Fall 2021 course "Introduction to mathematical Reasoning" at McMaster University.
