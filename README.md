# lecture-notes

These are my notes from some of the math courses I've taught as an instructor. They are freely available to use as you see fit.

`/linear_algebra` contains full lecture notes and tutorial problems from teaching a first course in linear algebra for science students (MATH 223) at the University of Toronto in 2017 (I also taught the same course in 2016). 

`/combinatorics` contains partial lecture notes from teaching undergraduate combinatorics at McMaster University in 2020.

`/graph_theory` contains selected course materials from teaching undergraduate graph theory at McMaster University in 2019.

`/proofs` contains lecture slides from the Fall 2021 course "Introduction to Mathematical Reasoning" at McMaster University which covers logic, proofs, and the basic tools of mathematical problem solving (numbers, sets, functions, relations, etc.).
