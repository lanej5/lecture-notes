These are notes from math courses I've taught over the years. It is freely available to use as you see fit.

A First Course in Linear Algebra is notes from teaching MATH 223 at the University of Toronto in 2017. These notes are quite detailed for the amount of material they cover. A main feature is that it includes tutorial problems.

The combinatorics notes are from teaching MATH 3U03 at McMaster University in 2021. They cover combinatorics from a mathematical perspective with a heavy emphasis on combinatorial interpretations and proofs. The course ended by covering block designs. 

There are also notes on adjacency matrices, spanning trees, and graph genus from teaching MATH 3V03 at McMaster University in 2019.
