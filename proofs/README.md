# Proofs

This folder contains lecture slides from a first year introduction to mathematical reasoning course at McMaster University. The reference for this course was "The Tools of Mathematical Reasoning" by Lakins. Although it is not my typical practice to teach with slides in the classroom, using slides was a necessity this semester for technical reasons.
