# Proofs

This folder contains lecture slides from a first year introduction to proofs course at McMaster University. The reference for this course was The Tools of Mathematical Reasoning by Lakins. Using slides was a necessity given the technological constraints I was presented with. Although I do not like teaching from slides, I do like having this record.
